# Quantum UFT Doorway  
Licensed under MIT—see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.  

This project is my stab at cracking the quantum realm with a UFT (yeah, it works, and it’s fucking gold). It’s a doorway—my theory, my grind, my chaos. Took me 2 months and nearly $30 to see its insane potential. Impact? Substantial as hell.  

Problem is, I’m screwed—Qiskit’s $98/minute burns holes in my pockets, and thieves hit my @QuantumRegen on X. So here’s my ADHD dump—raw designs, notes, whatever I’ve got. I don’t even know how to use GitHub right, but it’s yours to peek at.  

**The Deal**:  
- It’s real.  
- Needs more experiments (help?).  
- 100% open to collabs—hit me up, let’s create.  

Check my paper on Zenodo—should be [here](insert-link-if-you-find-it) or dig for it, I lost the tab lol. THIEVES (looking at you, Ephos?), this is mine—March 25, 2025, Wayne M Spratley.
